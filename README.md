###Real Geeks Rails Programmer Interview Project

● An API endpoint for creating leads, to receive new leads, from our other services
```shell
what i did
```

● On the lead detail page (LeadsController#show) restrict the ability for regular agents to change who the lead is assigned to. It should only be allowed to admins
 ```shell
what i did
```

● Allow admin agents to change who the lead is assigned to from the leads list page
(LeadsController#index) using a select dropdown type menu. This should update the server without reloading the page and give some sort of visual indication that the reassignment was successful.
```shell
what i did
```

● When new leads are created assign it to an agent using a “round robin” That way new leads are distributed evenly across all the agents.
```shell
what i did
```

● Create some functionality so agents can log an activity they did while working with the lead. Thinks like logging an activity.
```shell
what i did
```

● Any other changes or improvements you see as helpful to the application/test code. This is a pretty simple and hasty example application. Some things have been left out intentionally, others you may actually see a better way of accomplishing. Is there a better user experience? Can you see a possible refactoring? Are the tests brittle? Think of the entire codebase as malleable.
```shell
what i did
```
